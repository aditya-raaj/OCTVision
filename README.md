# OCTVision - AI-Powered Retinal Disease Detection

## Overview

**OCTVision** is a web-based application that leverages AI to perform automated retinal disease detection from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scan images. It is designed to assist ophthalmologists and healthcare professionals in diagnosing various retinal conditions such as **Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV)**, **Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)**, and **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)** by analyzing OCT scans.

This repository contains the source code for the application and a description of how it works.

# Retina Based Diseases


## For CNV (Choroidal Neovascularization):

- **Recommendation**:
    - **Immediate Referral**: Seek prompt evaluation by a retinal specialist. CNV is often associated with conditions like age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and can lead to significant vision loss if left untreated.
    - **Treatment Options**:
        - **Anti-VEGF Therapy**: Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections such as Ranibizumab or Aflibercept are commonly used to halt or slow the progression of CNV.
        - **Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)**: In some cases, photodynamic therapy may be used alongside anti-VEGF injections.
        - **Laser Treatment**: Though less commonly used now, laser therapy may be recommended in certain situations.
    - **Lifestyle and Monitoring**:
        - **Diet**: A diet rich in leafy greens, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants (e.g., lutein, zeaxanthin) can help support retinal health.
        - **Supplements**: Consider supplements such as AREDS2 formulation for patients with AMD.
        - **Regular Monitoring**: Repeat OCT scans every 1 to 3 months to assess response to treatment and progression of disease.
    - **Next Steps**:
        - Schedule immediate follow-up with a retina specialist.
        - If receiving anti-VEGF injections, expect regular treatments initially, with the frequency tapering as the condition stabilizes.
