cnv = """<pre><b>For CNV (Choroidal Neovascularization):</b>
- <b>Recommendation</b>: 
    - <b>Immediate Referral</b>: Seek prompt evaluation by a retinal specialist. CNV is often associated with conditions like age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and can lead to significant vision loss if left untreated.
    - <b>Treatment Options</b>: 
      - <b>Anti-VEGF Therapy</b>: Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections such as Ranibizumab or Aflibercept are commonly used to halt or slow the progression of CNV.
      - <b>Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)</b>: In some cases, photodynamic therapy may be used alongside anti-VEGF injections.
      - <b>Laser Treatment</b>: Though less commonly used now, laser therapy may be recommended in certain situations.
    - <b>Lifestyle and Monitoring</b>: 
      - <b>Diet</b>: A diet rich in leafy greens, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants (e.g., lutein, zeaxanthin) can help support retinal health.
      - <b>Supplements</b>: Consider supplements such as AREDS2 formulation for patients with AMD.
      - <b>Regular Monitoring</b>: Repeat OCT scans every 1 to 3 months to assess response to treatment and progression of disease.
    - <b>Next Steps</b>: 
      - Schedule immediate follow-up with a retina specialist.
      - If receiving anti-VEGF injections, expect regular treatments initially, with the frequency tapering as the condition stabilizes.

dme = """<pre><b>For DME (Diabetic Macular Edema):</b>
- <b>Recommendation</b>:
    - <b>Endocrinology Consultation</b>: In addition to ophthalmic care, close coordination with an endocrinologist is essential to manage systemic diabetes, which directly impacts the progression of DME.
    - <b>Treatment Options</b>: 
      - <b>Anti-VEGF Injections</b>: Similar to CNV, anti-VEGF therapy is the first-line treatment to reduce retinal swelling and improve vision.
      - <b>Corticosteroid Implants</b>: In cases where anti-VEGF is less effective, intravitreal steroid injections or implants may be considered.
      - <b>Laser Photocoagulation</b>: Focal or grid laser therapy may be used to treat areas of leakage, especially in non-central-involved DME.
    - <b>Blood Sugar and Blood Pressure Control</b>: 
      - <b>Strict Glycemic Control</b>: Keeping HbA1c levels below 7% is crucial to slowing the progression of diabetic retinopathy and macular edema.
      - <b>Blood Pressure Management</b>: Hypertension worsens DME; aim to maintain a blood pressure below 140/80 mmHg.
    - <b>Monitoring</b>:
      - <b>Frequent Eye Exams</b>: Patients with DME require regular OCT scans (every 3 to 6 months) to monitor fluid accumulation and treatment response.
      - <b>Diabetes Management</b>: Tight control of blood sugar and blood pressure levels will help prevent future episodes of macular edema.
    - <b>Next Steps</b>: 
      - Schedule a visit with both your retina specialist and endocrinologist.
      - Begin or continue anti-VEGF treatment as needed, and ensure systemic conditions are tightly managed.

drusen = """<pre><b>For Drusen (Early AMD):</b>
- <b>Recommendation</b>:
    - <b>Dietary Changes</b>: 
      - <b>High in Antioxidants</b>: Incorporate foods rich in vitamins C, E, zinc, copper, and beta-carotene, which can help slow the progression of AMD. Spinach, kale, and fish rich in omega-3s are beneficial.
      - <b>Supplements</b>: The <b>AREDS2</b> (Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2) formulation is recommended for patients at moderate to high risk of progression to advanced AMD.
    - <b>Lifestyle Modifications</b>: 
      - <b>Quit Smoking</b>: Smoking greatly increases the risk of AMD progression and should be avoided.
      - <b>UV Protection</b>: Wear sunglasses with UV protection to reduce retinal damage from harmful sunlight exposure.
    - <b>Monitoring</b>:
      - <b>Regular OCT Scans</b>: For early AMD or drusen, repeat OCT imaging every 6 to 12 months to track changes in retinal structure.
      - <b>Amsler Grid Monitoring</b>: Use an Amsler grid at home to self-monitor for sudden vision changes, such as wavy lines or blank spots, which could indicate progression to wet AMD.
    - <b>Next Steps</b>:
      - Discuss AREDS2 supplements and lifestyle changes with your healthcare provider.
      - Schedule routine OCT scans to monitor drusen size and any potential advancement of AMD.

normal = """<pre><b>For Normal Retina</b>
- <b>Recommendation</b>: 
    - <b>Routine Eye Care</b>: While your OCT scan shows a normal retina, itâ€™s essential to maintain regular eye exams, particularly if you have risk factors like a family history of retinal diseases.
    - <b>Eye Health Maintenance</b>:
      - <b>Balanced Diet</b>: Continue a diet rich in nutrients that support eye health, such as dark leafy greens, fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, and foods rich in antioxidants.
      - <b>Sun Protection</b>: Wear sunglasses with UV protection to minimize the risk of retinal damage from sunlight.
    - <b>Next Steps</b>:
      - If you have no symptoms or vision problems, follow up with routine eye exams as recommended by your ophthalmologist (typically every 1 to 2 years).
      - Maintain general health practices, including managing conditions like diabetes or hypertension that could affect retinal health.
